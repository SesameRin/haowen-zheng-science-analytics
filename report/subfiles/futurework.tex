\section{Future Work Suggestion}
\hspace{0.5cm} I think we're able to retrieve a relatively high quality data of faculty information using the methods we provided. Then we can classify these authors by certain attributes(age, gender, race, academic position) and see how these attributes affect their publication rate.
\par
Additionally, we have the capability to construct academic graphs comprising nodes for authors, works, and institutions. Then we can analyze co-authorship across institutions. For instance, it might be observed that authors affiliated with prestigious institutions exhibit a stronger inclination to collaborate with peers from similarly esteemed institutions. Does it mean that there exists an inequality in academic collaboration based on institution prestige rank? I think these questions are insteresting to explore and we may find more topics to research if we complete the academic graph and analyze it more deeply.
