\section{Reflection: What I Have Learned During This Research}
\hspace{0.5cm} During this research, my understanding of science analytics has deepened substantially. Every week, I read related papers and discussed project progress in our meetings. I got to know some academic databases like Openalex and Google Scholar and face recognition tools like OpenCV or Fairface. Furthermore, I acquired knowledge about the Neo4j graph database and obtain practical experience in data processing.
\par
One important thing I learned is how important accurate data is for any research project. We've discussed this issue and tried multiple methods during the process, which made me realize that doing research is a self-motivated task. When facing any troubles, we should always keep asking what caused this issue and how do we improve it. When reading papers, professor Kevin told us that we should always focus on how does the author come up with this idea and how does the author design the experiment. We are encouraged to think in the author's perspective and try to understand author's research process.
