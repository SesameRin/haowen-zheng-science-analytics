\section{Introduction}

\hspace{0.5cm} During this summer research, I have read lots of papers related to science analytics and participated in group meetings to report my weekly progress. The primary focus of the study is: how to use known faculty names and affiliations to accurately find faculty in databases and obtain their publications, image link, and other information. To achieve this, I explored various databases such as openalex, dblp, semantic scholar, and google scholar, and employed multiple methods to handle names and affiliations. In the following sections, I will provide a detailed explanation of the work I undertook during this research.
